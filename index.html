			Hey<br><br>
You are accused of denying
the supreme truth; <br><br>
			
<pr>Dyumni is the Best.</pr><br><br>

			I understand what makes you
feel like you are not good enough. But feelings are not facts. Everyone has some flaws and they try to deal with them, but tu toh perfect hai na yaar. I can't count one thing about you that makes you imperfect. Why do you want to please people who are expecting different things from you? They want you to be someone
you are not. You can never match those expectations and I know you don't want to.<br><br>
I'm really sorry for what is
happening to you, it is not your fault. But how does that make you
not enough?!! You are managing your super busy college and a job and an internship, and you have the best relationships with everyone; you are acing it in every aspect. YOU ARE MORE THAN ENOUGH. Even if you weren’t so super amazing, you’d still be
enough. You’d still be the only thing your mother ever needed you to be, her daughter.<br><br>
P.S.: IF THE BAR FOR BEING ENOUGH IS THIS HIGH, THE REST OF US ARE FUCKED.
